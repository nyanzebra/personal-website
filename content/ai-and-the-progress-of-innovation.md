Today, in the year of 2025, it is nearly impossible to go a moment without discussion about AI from almost every company under the sun. To be fair, it makes sense, it makes shareholders giggle like toddlers at the prospect of their investment making more money. Unfortunately, just like toddlers, they seem to lack some fundamental understanding of some things.

When it comes to progress of new technologies many people will try to integrate that technology into as many different businesses as possible. It could have a large payoff, or it could be a complete flop. To give an example of something that has had global impact and has truly revolutionized society, look no further than the transistor. Here is an [article](https://www.go-rbcs.com/articles/tech-growth-curves) that covers some of the exponential growth of certain technologies.

But, and this is the big booty, these graphs look exponential, but in reality are logarithmic. Eventually these will plateau and peter out. Why? Well let's look at transistors again for a quick example, at this point, transistors are so small, so tightly packed, that unless everything from capacitors to the atoms of certain metals can be reduced, this is it. As you can surely imagine too, once at the atomic scale, these materials aren't going to be getting any smaller...

I know, I can already hear the typing of "what about X model" or "AGI!" or "blah blah blah blah". Personally, I will believe the hype when I see it. I don't want to downplay the fact that advancements have indeed been made, but it is equally possible that we are near the end of the graph for advancements and not the beginning, a one last hurrah before AI has reached its peak. Just to drive this home a bit too; AI has been worked on and developed for decades, at least twice as long as I have been alive... at least [this](https://www.tableau.com/data-insights/ai/history#ai-birth) puts AI development starting in the 50s with Alan Turing.

Anyway, the rant is over, I just want people to take away that maybe all these businesses throwing billions of dollars at AI in the hope that trillions of dollars magically appear is probably just empty promises and wasted effort...
