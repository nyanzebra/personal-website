## Intro
A follow-up to this [article](./growing-as-an-engineer.md), I have been spending time working on improving communication, especially in system design interviews. I want to share a cool tool I have been using to do so :smile:.

## Hello Interview
[Hello Interview](https://www.hellointerview.com/) is an online tool that presents a way to structure talking about and organizing information for a system design interview. They have a number of practice questions such as: design a job scheduler or design a url shortener. Though what really sets this tool apart from others is the feedback loop. When going through a practice problem there is an agent that will read or listen to your words and point out flaws
or strengths. This is all coupled with an [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) instance where one can draw or design parts of the system one is trying to build. Which, perhaps more impressively, the agent can look at excalidraw and see your drawings and writings and assess them too.

Whether this is as good as having real peer review, I cannot say. But this is an excellent tool, and one that I feel is making me improve.
